wanderdrone
--

This is the code that runs the
[wanderdrone](http://www.aaronland.info/wanderdrone/). It is a plain vanilla web
application that will work in any modern browser.

**Note:** You will need to configure your own tile layer for the wanderdrone to
  wander around in. This is done in the [wanderdrone.js](https://github.com/straup/wanderdrone/blob/master/www/wanderdrone.js) file.

There is also a sample [tilestache.cfg](https://github.com/straup/wanderdrone/blob/master/tilestache/tilestache.cfg.example) file if you want to generate your own
"dithered" style map tiles using [TileStache](http://www.tilestache.org/) and
the [atkinstache](https://github.com/straup/tilestache-atkinstache) provider.
